# User picker
Many times we need to login with several types of users, and we don't have an easy way to exchange login data in insomnia.

This plugin aims to help you keep login data and easily exchange it when needed.

## Creating your first login entry
Click the Document dropdown menu.

and then add the form data.

- name: It is the user name that will appear in the menu;
- identifier: It is any identifier that will be used as a credential (E-mail, or username);
- password: It is the user's password;

After that the username will be available in the list
